The committee denied my request- the nerve! I have resorted to asking the locals about the Heqet's Pyramid. Most had no clue what I was asking about, but a few retorted a legend of the pyramid. The legend goes that the great snake Apep, the god of chaos and darkness, bit Heqet and poisoned her. Heqet called on the aid of Serket, the goddess of scorpions and healing venomous bites. Serket removed snake's venom from Heqet and stored it in one of Heqet's amulets. The amulet was then given to the pharaoh for protection from Apep. In recognition of her gift, the pharaoh built a pyramid for Heqet and stored the amulet there for safety. All this talk of frogs, snakes, and scorpions reminds me of a Aesop tale! I wonder if there is some ancient connection between the fables and the Egyptian mythology. </br> April 7th, 1749 </br> From looking deeper into Aesop tale of the scorpion and the frog, I believe I have found the location to unearth another amulet.");
